    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 25, 2023</p> <p>Thank you for using <strong>SalesRun</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Core Principle:</strong> SalesRun is a <strong>local-first application</strong>. We do not require you to create an account. We do not store your personal data, customer lists, or sales records on our servers. Your data stays on your device.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>Because SalesRun is an offline-capable app, we do not collect or store your personal information on external servers.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Data:</strong> Data you input (such as customer profiles, tasks, and sales products) is stored locally on your device's internal storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Images:</strong> Photos you take or upload are saved securely in the app's document sandbox on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. App Permissions</h2>
    <p>To provide specific features, SalesRun requests access to certain system permissions. You can revoke these permissions at any time in your device settings.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used to scan business cards for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and to take photos of customer storefronts. Images are processed locally or transiently via secure APIs (see Section 3) and are not stored by us.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> Used to allow you to upload existing photos for avatars or customer profiles, and to save generated reports (Excel/Images) to your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Used only while the app is in use to display your current location on the map, calculate distances to customers, and assist with route planning. We do not track or store your location history on our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or transfer your data to outside parties. However, the app may use trusted third-party services to support specific functionalities:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini API (Generative AI):</strong> If you use the "AI Business Card Scan" feature, the text data recognized from the image is sent to Google's generative AI service for formatting (e.g., extracting Name/Phone accurately). This data is used solely for processing and returning the result to you; it is not used to train their models or stored by us.</li>
        <li><strong>Map Services (Apple Maps / Google Maps):</strong> Map functionalities are provided by system-native map SDKs. Your interaction with the map is governed by the respective platform's privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Backup and Security</h2>
    <p><strong>You are responsible for your data.</strong> Since we do not host a cloud database for your account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All backups generated by the "Cloud Backup Service" feature are stored locally on your device as <code>.srb</code> files.</li>
        <li>You can manage these files via the iOS "Files" app or iTunes File Sharing.</li>
        <li>If you delete the app without a backup, your data may be permanently lost. We cannot recover it for you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at:</p>
